Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

To display a less than sign (<) we must write &lt or &#60.

In Python there is the html module that I can use to escape the html characters.

Datatyping:

Instead of creating variables like a = 12 I can also declare the data type
of variable with a: int. And leave like that. If I declare the var later on
it has to be an int.

I can also specify a datatype inside a function.

def police_check(age: int):
    if age > 18:
        can_drive = True
    else:
        can_drive = False
    return can_drive

In addition, I can also specify the output data type:

def police_check(age: int) -> bool:
    if age > 18:
        can_drive = True
    else:
        can_drive = False
    return can_drive

This is called 'Type Hints'.
